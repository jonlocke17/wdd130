    <h2>Jon Locke</h2>
<p>Hello! My family and I are currently residing in South Dakota, USA.</p>
    <p>Born and brought up in New Hampshire, my life took an exciting turn when I met my wife in Lowell, Massachusetts, through the Pathway program 6 years ago.</p>
<p>From the lush landscapes of Oregon to the plains of South Dakota, where we moved a year ago, our journey has been nothing short of an adventure.</p> 
    <p>Our family includes our energetic three-year-old daughter and a faithful dog Gracie, both bringing immense joy into our lives.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include playing ping pong, immersing myself in audiobooks and podcasts while at work. My wife and I like to play board games whenever we get the spare time.</p>
